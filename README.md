# Lending-Club-Case-Study
```
To detect risky applicants who have applied for loan
```

## Purpose of analysis
``` This analysis is for lending companies. It will be helpful to catch risky/default applicants which are major reason of financial loss. These borrowers refuse to pay or runs away with the money owed.

The dataset which we have contains information about past loan applicants and whether they ‘defaulted’ or not. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.

The company wants to understand the driving factors behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment
